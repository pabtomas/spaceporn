First off, thank you for considering contributing to the **spaceporn-wiki**.

Because this part of this repository is mainly documentation for learning
purpose and not coding, make a pull request is not well-suited. The best way
to contribute is to open an issue.

**Why should I open an issue ?**

If you think there are a good reason to open an issue for the
**spaceporn-wiki**, you should. Here some of these reasons (but there are many
more):
- `1` A fix. As mentioned in the [home page](home), the author is not a pro
graphic developer. In addition he is not a teacher and is not a native english
speaker. So there are potentially a lot of thing that can be improved. So if
you think you found:
    - a misspelling,
    - a shader error,
    - a bad practice,
    - a maths knowledges leak,
    - a bad algorithm,
    - a bad implementation,
    - an unprecision,
    - a leak of pedagogy/methodology,
    - something you can improve,

    this is (at least) the best reason to open an issue.

- `2` Sharing an article/tutorial which could allow a better understanding of
a tutorial aspect.
- `3` For a tutorial request of the **spaceporn-gen** graphic content.

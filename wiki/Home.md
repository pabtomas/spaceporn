The **spaceporn-wiki** is a list of GLSL tutorials and online fragment shaders
to generate procedural pixelized space content. Shaders documented are or will
be integrated in the **spaceporn-gen**.

### Before going further

Tutorials are not written by a pro graphic programmer. The author did not
receive a formal shadering formation. The author learned by himself (and from
ressources found on Internet). So details are explained the way the author
understand them. This is why:
- tutorials can leak some knowledges and/or precision,
- articles/tutorials are linked as mush as possible.

### Prerequites

The author assumes:
- you have maths knowledges (or at least curious and not afraid about
maths),
- you know what is a fragment shader,
- you already have basic knowlegde of GLSL shaders. At least about specific
types (*vec2*, *vec3*, *vec4*, *ivec2*, *uvec2*, *mat2*, ...) and built-in
functions (*abs()*, *sin()*, *floor()*, *fract()*, *length()*, ...).

If not, you can follow this tutorial but it will not be easy. So the authors
advise you to do some reading/testing first.

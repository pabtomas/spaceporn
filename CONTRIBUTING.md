# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the **spaceporn generator**.

**Secondly, while this project is not in a stable state, maintainers will not accept a pull request. Rules described here will be applied when the spaceporn generator will be released.**

## Feature request

If you think a missing feature can be valuable for this project and its users, the maintainers would be interested to discuss about it in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tiawl/spaceporn/issues). Do not hesitate to join pictures and/or shaders if you request a graphic content.

## Bugs

If a bug happens to you, the maintainers would be happy if you could open an issue. Ensure that you include:
- Operating System (and your Window Manager if possible),
- a brief description of the problem with steps to reproduce,
- your graphic hardware (GPU) and its driver,
- the log file/trace execution (if you did not use `RealeaseFast` during building).

## Security

If you think you have found a security issue, please do not mention it in this repository. Instead, send a message to **u/tiawl Reddit user**.

## Make a pull request

Before you start any Pull Request, you should take a look at the 2 sections below. Then it is highly recommended to create an issue to discuss first. That way you can be sure that:
- the maintainers agree on what to change and how,
- you have all information you need,
- you are not working on something that someone is already working on.

### Maintainers' roadmap

Here the maintainers' [todolist for each release](https://github.com/tiawl/spaceporn/milestones). Issues are expressed as tasks by the maintainers for the maintainers. It is not intented to be read by others so maybe it is missing context. But if you want to contribute without going against the maintainers' work, you should consider those lists. If you do not really know what a task is talking about and it might be a problem for a future contribution: feel free to commit the issue to ask more details.
